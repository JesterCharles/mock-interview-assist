# Project State — v1.5 Production Migration

## Current Position

Phase: Not started (defining requirements)
Plan: —
Status: Defining requirements
Last activity: 2026-04-18 — Milestone v1.5 started via `/gsd-new-milestone v1.5`

## Project Reference

See: `.planning/PROJECT.md`

**Core value:** Associates get consistent, feedback-rich practice reps that adapt to their weaknesses — replacing snapshot audits with continuous improvement trajectories.

**Current focus:** v1.5 — migrate v1.0-v1.4 codebase from legacy v0.1 GCE to Cloud Run + Supabase hybrid; ship staging + CI/CD + k6 load-test baseline; cut DNS from v0.1 to new prod without breaking existing public-interview users.

## v1.5 Direction (finalized in discover)

- **Approach C — Hybrid:** Cloud Run app + Supabase DB/auth (both stay). Supabase = company-standard, cloud-agnostic for future AWS migration.
- **Judge0 integration points only** (env vars, facade, `judge0.tf.disabled` stub) — self-hosted IaC deferred to v1.6.
- **P0 scope:** staging Cloud Run + staging Supabase project + deploy-on-tag CI/CD + k6 single-instance load-test baseline.
- **HARD-01/02/03** carried from v1.4 — executed under the deployed stack.
- **Env hygiene reset:** wipe dirty dev data from existing "prod" Supabase, reseed staging with demo data, reserve prod for real users.
- **DNS cutover:** Cloudflare Free Tier on `nextlevelmock.com`; 30-day `legacy.nextlevelmock.com` rollback window.

### Finalized IDs (for execute phase)

- GCP projects: `nlm-prod`, `nlm-staging-493715` (suffix accepted — `nlm-staging` globally taken)
- GCP billing: `01A910-0C5083-DCCFED` (active)
- Supabase staging ref: `lzuqbpqmqlvzwebliptj`
- Supabase prod: existing (will be wiped + reseeded clean at first execute phase)
- DNS: Cloudflare Free Tier on `nextlevelmock.com`

## Performance Metrics (shipped milestones)

- v1.0: 7 phases, 22 reqs, ~26h
- v1.1: 8 phases, 14 reqs, ~24h, 131 commits
- v1.2: 10 phases, 30 reqs, ~16h, 205 commits, 470 tests
- v1.3: 11 phases (incl. decimal 28.1), 18 plans, 27 reqs, ~2 days, 524 passing tests
- v1.4: 9 phases (36-44), 28 plans, 44 reqs, 963 passing tests

## Open Blockers Carried Forward

- HARD-01 / HARD-02 / HARD-03 — live load test, live abuse test, live security review. All require deployed stack. v1.4 checkpoint: `.planning/milestones/v1.4-phases/44-hardening-load-test/LOAD-TEST-CHECKPOINT.md`. Folded into v1.5 scope.
- v1.4 reflect + maintain deferred — run as part of v1.5 ship.
